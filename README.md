#
BlueSense is an interactive platform that allows users to analyze sentiment around specific topics or keywords on **BlueSky**, an open-source, decentralized social media platform launched in 2023 as an alternative to Twitter/X. On BlueSense users can input topics of interest, and the system retrieves relevant posts to perform sentiment analysis, presenting results through intuitive visualizations.

BlueSense provides a simple yet powerful interface that enables users to:

- **Input Topics**: Enter keywords, hashtags, or phrases through a user-friendly web interface.
- **Data Collection**: Upon input, the system makes targeted API calls to BlueSky to retrieve a sample of posts (100) related to the specified topic.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Each retrieved post undergoes sentiment analysis using Google Cloud Natural Language API to classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Results Visualization**: The system provides a comprehensive analysis through multiple interactive tabs:
    - **Overview Tab**:
        - Overall sentiment distribution pie chart showing percentages of positive/negative/neutral posts
        - Sentiment score distribution histogram
        - Top 5 most positive and negative posts with their scores and authors
    - **Temporal Analysis Tab**:
        - Interactive timeline showing sentiment trends over time (day of use)
        - Common terms analysis by sentiment category
    - **Advanced Analysis Tab**:
        - Sentiment score vs. magnitude scatter plot
        - Detailed explanation of sentiment metrics
        - Raw data view of all analyzed posts
